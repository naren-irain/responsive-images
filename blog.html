<h1>Responsive images</h1>

<p>
    - Images has the important role in the content representation in most of the websites
    - And it is the largest part in a web page interms of the page size and the load time apart from video and audio.
    - In the modern world there are different kind of displays and screen resolutions. 
    - Showing the same image for all these screens are not ideally good.
    - This responsive images technique helps us to display the best image based on the device and screen capabilities.

    - Before that, look at the history of the responsive images integration
    - Setting max-width: 100%; for <img> tag. so, it will scale-up and scale-down to the container size
    - Changing background-image in media-queries
    - Fit the images with background-size
    - Handling icons in the fonts like fontawesome, icomoon or bootstrap glyphicons
    - Now, we have more controls with picture tag, srcset and src-set(). Lets start about these

<p>picture&gt;</p>

    - The picture tag is very similar in the concept to the audio and video elements. But in picture we need both sources and img tag.
    - First there will be set of sources with some conditions to display.
    - srcset attrubute to give the source file path
    - media attribute for media query conditions
    - type attribute for image type declaration
    - A standard img tag is the last required element. It functions as a proxy for the <var>&lt;source&gt;<var> elements to display their content; it also acts as a fallback for browsers that don't understand picture and don't run the polyfill described below.
</p>
<p>
    - First it will check the first source, if the condition is true then it won't consider below sources
    - Use it for art direction
